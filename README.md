# Web Development
Assignments for my Web Development course. The text in webpages is in Greek.

## Assignment #1 
A website about an academic topic. My website is about cellular networks and 5G. Using HTML5, CSS3 with Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout design, Media Queries and Responsive images, and Javascript for some interactivity (hidden text, theme change, different text and color per day of the week). Plus a sign-up form with a questionaire, using HTML5 validation rules and the JS Constraint Validation API.

## Assignment #2 
TBA
