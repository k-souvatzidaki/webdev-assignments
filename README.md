# Web Development
Assignments for my Web Development course. The text in webpages is in Greek.

## Assignment #1 
A website about an academic topic. My website is about cellular networks and 5G. Using HTML5, CSS3 with Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout design, Media Queries and Responsive images, and Javascript for some interactivity (hidden text, theme change, different text and color per day of the week). Plus a sign-up form with a questionaire, using HTML5 validation rules and the JS Constraint Validation API.

## Assignment #2 
A web application for an online library. Using an existing bookstore API (Penguin Random House) and the Javascript Fetch API. Also a Node.js server using the Express and Express-Handlebars Javascript frameworks to manage a favorite books(works) list, serving requests to add, remove, edit or view works on that list.
